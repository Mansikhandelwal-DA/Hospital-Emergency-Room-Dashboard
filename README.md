# EMERGENCY ROOM DATA PROJECT: ANALYSE KEY HOSPITAL INSIGHTS BY AN INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD
## Introduction:
I recently completed a project focused on analyzing hospital staff and patient data. This project presents an interactive dashboard created in Excel, leveraging Power Query, pivot tables, slicers, and data visualization tools to analyze emergency room (ER) performance metrics. The analysis provides actionable insights into patient flow, waiting times, discharge rates, and other key operational factors that impact ER efficiency.
## Objective:
The main goal of this dashboard is to analyze and optimize emergency room operations by identifying bottlenecks, patient trends, and areas of improvement, ultimately aiding in better resource allocation and decision-making.
## Tools and Techniques Used:
•	**Microsoft Excel:** Primary tool for data analysis and visualization.<br>
•	**Power Query:** Data cleaning and transformation.<br>
•	**Pivot Tables & Charts:** Summarizing data and deriving insights.<br>
•	**Slicers & Filters:** Enabling interactivity and user-friendly navigation.<br>
•	**Conditional Formatting:** Highlighting key trends and critical metrics.<br>
## Key Insights: 
•	**Total Patients Analyzed:** 10,000+ patient records<br>
•	**Average Waiting Time:** Reduced from 2.5 hours to 1.8 hours in optimized cases.<br>
•	**Peak ER Hours:** Highest patient influx observed between 6 PM - 11 PM.<br>
•	**Most Common Patient Issues:** 35% of visits were due to minor injuries and infections, while 20% were critical cases requiring immediate attention.<br>
•	**Discharge Rate:** 65% of patients were discharged within 4 hours, while 15% required hospitalization.<br>
•	**Resource Allocation:** Identified shortage of doctors during peak hours, leading to a 25% increase in patient wait times.<br>
•	**Patient Satisfaction:** Higher satisfaction reported when waiting time was under 2 hours.<br>
## Visual Analysis of Key Metrics:

## Features of the Dashboard:
•	**Dynamic Filters & Slicers:** Filter data by date, patient type, issue severity, and doctor availability.<br>
•	**Trend Analysis:** Monthly trends of patient volume and treatment efficiency.<br>
•	**Interactive Visualizations:** Bar charts, line graphs, and KPI indicators for quick insights.<br>
•	**Performance Metrics:** Breakdown of patient wait times, treatment durations, and discharge rates.<br>

## Conclusion:
Hospital management can use this analysis to **optimize ER staffing** and reduce patient wait times.Doctors and nurses can **prioritize critical cases** based on patient influx trends.Administrators can evaluate **resource utilization** and improve overall ER efficiency.
